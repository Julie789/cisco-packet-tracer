This exercise will help in setting up and understanding the cisco packet tracer. 
It is an exciting tool for network design, simulation and modelling which will help to develop the skills in networking, 
cybersecurity and Internet of Things (IoT). 
It is an innovative network configuration simulation tool, which will help to sharpen our network configuration skills 
from desktop or mobile device.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Install Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.
* Explore different options available in Packet Tracer.
* Create a simple network.

== Steps

=== Step 1: Download and Install Packet Tracer

To install your copy of Cisco Packet Tracer, follow the below mentioned steps: 

1. Enroll to the Cisco Networking Academy using _https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer_. Log into your _I'm Learning_ page.
2. Select _Resources_ from the menu in the upper right portion of your screen.
3. Select _Download Packet Tracer_.
4. Choose the OS you are using and download the relevant files.
5. Run the Packet Tracer setup executable file.
6. Launch the Cisco Packet Tracer, authenticate using your Netcad login information.
7. Packet Tracer is ready to be explored.

=== Step 2: Packet Tracer App Walkthrough

It has the File menu commands (**Open, Save, Save As, Exit**) similar to the word processor or the spreadsheet. 
The two special commands it has are the **Open Samples** and the **Exit and Logout** command. 
The **Open Samples** will display the prebuilt network configurations available with the App.
The **Exit and Logout** will remove the registration information for this copy of the App and will require to do the login again.

The different categories of toolbars exist in below left corner of the App. 
All these devices can be interconnected within Cisco Packet Tracer. 
Choose any of the device from the list and start exploring.

* Network Devices: It has different sub categories of Routers, Switches, Hubs, Wireless Devices, Security and WAN Emulation.
* End Devices: It has End Devices, Home, Smart City, Industrial, Power Grid.
* Components: It has Boards, Actuators and Sensors. It can be included to make internet of things packet tracer.
* Connections: It will help to interconnect your devices via cables or structured cabling.
* Miscellaneous: It has prebuilt network devices and end devices installed on them.
* Multiuser Connection: It will have the ability to interconnect multiple packet tracers to build larger topology.

On the top left corner, we will find different options to select, zoom, delete devices. 
It has various other options which can be explored going through the class.

=== Step 3: Finding, Deploying and Cabling Devices.

Now it's time to create a simple network using Switches and PCs. 

==== List of Devices Required: 

* 2960 Switch (from Network Device -> Switches): 2
* PC (End Devices -> End Devices): 6
* Copper Straight-Through Cable (Connections -> Connections): 6
* Copper Cross-Over Cable (Connections -> Connections): 1

==== How to Deploy Devices:

1. First locate the 2960 Switch from the Device-Specific Selection box shown below.

2. Click on the 2960 Switch and drag to your Logical Workspace. Add one more switch to your workspace.
3. Similarly add PC from the End Devices tab.

Tip #1
If you want to put multiple devices of the same type onto the workspace, the clicking and dragging
can become very tedious. To avoid this, hold down the <CTRL> key as you click on the device in
the Device-Specific Selection box.

4. Hold the <CTRL> key and click on the logical workspace for 5 more PCs. 
To cancel the operation, click on the Cancel symbol shown below.

==== How to Cable the devices:

Click on the category that looks like a lightning bolt labeled Connections. In the Device-Specific
Selection box, there will appear a series of cable types. Select the Copper Straight-Through
cable type. Now point at the center of PC0 and click on it. You will see a pop-up menu appear
showing the cable connection types. Point at, and click on the FastEthernet0 selection. Now a
wire will appear anchored to the PC. Point at Switch0, and click on it. Another pop-up menu will
appear with a much larger set of selections. Point at and click on the FastEthernet0/1 selection.
The cable will now be connected and two blinking link lights will appear, one green and one
amber. After a while the amber light will turn green.

Now connect all the remaining five PC with the Switch.

* PC1 FastEthernet0 to Switch0 FastEthernet0/2
* PC2 FastEthernet0 to Switch0 FastEthernet0/3
* PC3 FastEthernet0 to Switch1 FastEthernet0/1
* PC4 FastEthernet0 to Switch1 FastEthernet0/2
* PC5 FastEthernet0 to Switch1 FastEthernet0/3

To connect between the Switch, we will require Copper Cross-Over Cable. Click on it and then point at and click on Switch0. From the pop-up menu select the Gigabit0/1 interface near the bottom of the list. Then point at and click
Switch1 and select the same interface from this list. The cable will appear and both link lights
will be amber, but will eventually turn to green after about a minute.

You can customize the user experience based on your requirement. 
Explore the different options available in `Options -> Preferences`. 
After building, the network will look like the image shown below:

== Activity: Build the topology

Create the network shown below:

  a) Use port FastEthernet0/1 on the switch for PC0
  b) Use port FastEthernet0/2 on the switch for PC1
  c) Use port FastEthernet0/3 on the switch for Server0
