This exercise will help to learn the simulation mode of Packet Tracer and also about the physical view of the network. 
The simulation mode enables you to confirm device availability and to think about how the different kinds of information traverse your system.
This mode is used to observe the traffic in detail with time controlled by the user.
It will enable to create and capture PDUs to check several functions of the network, like:

  * Basic Connectivity
  * Security
  * Applications and Services

Packet tracer also has the physical workspace that allows to make network more realistic by adding backgrounds, buildings, and 
wiring closets. These features are important for documentation, design, and visualization. You can see the actual layout of the 
network within a room or a building. This provides valuable information into the flow of traffic and the suitability and placement 
of equipment. The Physical view also has a great feature that shows the wireless coverage areas based on your equipment placement 
within buildings.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Investigate network functionality using Packet Tracer Simulation mode.
* Understand the Physical view of the network.
* How to use it as assessment tool.

== Creating and viewing the contents of PDUs

A PDU is a Protocol Data Unit, a message type that is going to transfer between network devices. 
In earlier labs, the network was created using the realtime mode, which is the default, now we will be using simulation mode.
Simulation mode allows us to create PDUs and view their contents. 

Lets start understanding the networking fundamentals through simulation.
In this excercise we will cover first chapters 3 and 4 of the begineer's course.

**_Chapter 3: Explore Network Functionality Using PDUs_**

This chapter will help you to use simualtion mode to create PDUs to replicate ICMP and ARP functionality and how to create more
complex PDUs from the list of protocols such as DNS, HTTP, Telnet, SSH etc.
Lets understand through different activity mentioned in the course.

  * Complete the activity of _Explore Network Functionality using PDUs_ mentioned in the 
  _Section 3.1.1.3: Packet Tracer - Explore Network Functionality using PDUs_

**_Chapter 4: Packet Tracer Usage_** 

This chapter will help you to get an idea of the Physical view and to assess the different file types created by Packet Tracer.
It shows the relationships of the network devices along with the buildings and distance factors in the design.
Lets understand how to use Physical view through activity mentioned in the course.

* Complete the activity of _Packet Tracer Physical View_ mentioned in the 
_Section 4.1.1.2: Packet Tracer - Packet Tracer Physical View_

The packet tracer has the ability to create three different file types: .pkt, .pkz, and .pka. 
Learn more about them in _Section 4.2.1.1: Packet Tracer File Types_.

== Exercise

Examine the functionality of all the OSI Model layers.

== Thought Questions

=== Basics

1. What is a PDU?
2. What is the difference between Realtime mode and Simulation mode, Logical view and Physical view?
3. What are the different layers of the OSI model?
4. What are the different types of files created in Cisco Packet Tracer?

=== Do some research

1. How the data is transmitted between networks? 
2. What are the contents of each layer of the OSI model when the data is transmitted?
